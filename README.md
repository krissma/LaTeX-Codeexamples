# LaTeX-Codeexamples

A small collection of LaTeX examples with some explanations and comments by me.

## Building the material
The easiest way is using an editor like TeXstudio (https://www.texstudio.org/) to compile the tex files. 

To e.g. build the example paper on a console, navigate to the directory Example_Paper and run `pdflatex figures_examples.tex`. You will probably have to run this several times. This is normal LaTeX behaviour. You can also use `latexmk-pdf figures_examples.tex`. This command has to be run only once.
